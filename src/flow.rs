//! The references of an index, attributed to the definition that holds them.
//!
//! `must_not_reach` follows imports between files, so calling one function of a
//! file reaches everything the file imports. With `reach: symbols` a chain follows
//! the definitions a call references instead: a node is a method or function (a
//! symbol with the lines it spans) or what a file holds outside any of them (its
//! class bodies, constants, top-level code), and an edge is a reference at a line.
//!
//! A dependency that no reference accounts for stays an edge to everything in its
//! target, and so does a class or constant used with no method named, so no import
//! is dropped for want of a range. The index is read into a flow in `scip::Indexed::flow`.
